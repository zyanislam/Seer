# Seer

A Web-based Platform for Students & Teachers where the teachers can update their individual progress throughout the semester/trimester. And as the scores are constantly updated, each student will get constructive feedback on how much marks they need to obtain or on what grade they are on track off. Initally, the students are asked to enter a grade they expect from the course they have taken and based on that, the roadmap is created.
